# Advent of Code 2024

Advent of Code is an annual event that runs during the first 25 days of December. Each day, a new programming puzzle is released on the [Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com/). The puzzles typically involve problems related to algorithms, data structures, and computational thinking.

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2024 challenges, written in **Go**. I'll be updating this repo daily with new solutions as the puzzles are released.
